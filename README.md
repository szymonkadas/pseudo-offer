Project is mobile friendly, used basic frontend technologies with addition of scss. 

# Used tech: 
JS, SCSS, HTML.

# Notes:
- Website design is made entirely by me (aswell as code - just in case if someone's wondering ehu).
- project had to pass some tests on fcc to meet mvp requirements.
- Legacy site purpose was to be certification site for fcc certification, but tbh first iteration of this project that i've made looong time ago (1st grade tech school) was so horrifying, i've decided to polish my scss and js skills with this reiteration of old project.
